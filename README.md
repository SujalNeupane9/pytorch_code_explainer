# Pytorch code explainer

This is a PyTorch implementation of a text generation model using the ROUGE metric for evaluation. The model is trained using GradScaler and autocast for faster and more stable training, and the learning rate is adjusted using a scheduler. The code also includes evaluation of the model using the ROUGE metric, with average scores calculated for rouge1, rouge2, and rougeL.
